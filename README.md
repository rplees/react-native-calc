## Getting Started

### Requirements **[详细环境搭建请参考](http://rplees.com/2016/01/14/react_native%E7%8E%AF%E5%A2%83%E6%90%AD%E5%BB%BA/)**
- OS X - This repo only contains the iOS implementation right now, and Xcode only runs on Mac.
- New to Xcode? Download it from the Mac App Store.
- Homebrew is the recommended way to install node, watchman, and flow.
- **brew install node**. New to node or npm?
- **brew install watchman**. We recommend installing watchman, otherwise you might hit a node file watching bug.
- **brew install flow**. If you want to use flow.
### Quick start 
- **npm install -g react-native-cli**
- **react-native init Calc --verbose**

In the newly created folder Calc/

- Open Calc.**xcodeproj** and hit run in Xcode
- Open **index.ios.js** in your text editor of choice and edit some lines
- Hit **cmd+R** (twice) in your iOS simulator to reload the app and see your change!

**Congratulations**! You've just successfully run and modified your first React Native app.
